This is a simple stopwatch application implemented in C#. It allows you to count time for a specified duration and displays the elapsed seconds.

## Usage

When you run the program, you will be presented with a menu. Follow the instructions below to use the stopwatch:

- Enter the duration you want to count in the format of `<time><unit>`. For example:
   - `10s` to count 10 seconds
   - `5m` to count 5 minutes
   - `0` to exit the program

- After entering the desired duration, the stopwatch will start counting down.

- Once the specified duration is reached, the stopwatch will be finished, and the program will display "Stopwatch finished".

- You can then return to the menu to start a new countdown or exit the program.

This console application was created using [Balta.io](https://balta.io/)'s backend course. I recommend checking it out if you're interested in learning about .NET programming.
